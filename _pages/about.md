I obtained Ph.D. degree in image processing from the [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), University of Paris-Saclay, Paris, France under the guidance of [Isabelle Bloch](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/bloch/) and [Florence Rossant](https://sites.google.com/site/rossantflorence/home/about-me). I completed M.S. (Research) degree in signal and image processing from [IMT Atlantique](http://imt-atlantique.fr/), France. I am  currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, India. My research interests include variational methods in image segmentation, action recognition, and deep learning methods for scene understanding.
