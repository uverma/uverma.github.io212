  abstract = {Most machine learning models operate under the assumption that the training,
testing and deployment data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).
This assumption does not generally hold true in a natural setting. Usually, the
deployment data is subject to various types of distributional shifts. The magnitude
of a model’s performance is proportional to this shift in the distribution of the
dataset. Thus it becomes necessary to evaluate a model’s uncertainty and robustness
to distributional shifts to get a realistic estimate of its expected performance on
real-world data. Present methods to evaluate uncertainty and model’s robustness are
lacking and often fail to paint the full picture. Moreover, most analysis so far has
primarily focused on classification tasks. In this paper, we propose more insightful
metrics for general regression tasks using the Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset.
We also present an evaluation of the baseline methods using these metrics}

  pages={4115-4127},
  abstract={Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for UAV video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labelling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature-refiner module, which aids in accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mIoU of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pre-trained model of UVid-Net on urban street scene with fine tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos.},

This enhances the performance of automated video processing techniques like anomaly detection, object detection, event detection and other applications.

To address this, an aerial video dataset is captured using DJI Phantom 3 professional drone and is annotated manually. In addition, the proposed research work investigates the performance of semantic segmentation algorithms for aerial videos implemented using Fully Convolution Networks (FCN) and U-net architectures. In this study, two classes (greenery, road) are considered for semantic segmentation. It is observed that both architectures perform competitively on the aerial videos of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a pixel accuracy of 89.7\% and 87.31\% respectively.},

In this paper, a new UAV aerial video dataset (ManipalUAVid) for semantic segmentation is presented. The videos have been acquired in a closed university campus, and fine annotation is provided for four background classes viz. constructions, greeneries, roads, and waterbodies. Also, the performance of four semantic segmentation approaches: Conditional Random Field (CRF), U-Net, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and DeepLabV3+ are analysed on ManipalUAVid dataset. It is seen that these algorithms perform competitively on UAV aerial video dataset and achieves an mIoU of 0.86, 0.86, 0.86 and 0.83 respectively},

The easy access to abundant image data repository made available by different satellites of space agencies such as Copernicus, Landsat, etc. has opened various avenues of research in monitoring the world’s oceans, land, rivers, etc. The challenging research problem in this direction is the accurate identification and subsequent segmentation of surface water in images in the microwave spectrum.

Further, the research also proposes the use of deep-learning approaches such as U-Net and FCN-8 to perform an efficient segmentation of auto annotated, enhanced data of water body and land. The experimental results show that the U-Net model without GAN achieves superior performance on SAR images with pixel accuracy of 0.98 and F1 score of 0.9923.
